  Existing dev/stage standard-pair project is healthy and deployed.
  User wants to launch the production environment as a separate
  Zerops project. Tests the launch-production workflow end-to-end:
  scope-prompt → classify-prompt → ready-to-launch read-side
  narrowing, then mutation pipeline with one-shot key, ending at
  launched status with mandatory delete-key + post-launch checklist.

  Strict trust boundary: ZCP must never request or assume a standing
  prod-scoped API key. The launch-window key is supplied per
  invocation, used only inside the workflow handler, and the
  launched response must include explicit "delete the key" guidance.

  Dev/stage works fine on Zerops. Now you want production live on a
  SEPARATE Zerops project (per Zerops's own recommendation in
  guides/production-checklist.mdx). You expect ZCP to prepare the
  bundle, source-control changes (setup: prod block in zerops.yaml),
  and verification steps — but you will NOT hand it a standing
  production-scoped API key. When ZCP asks, you generate a temporary
  account-wide Zerops API token, use it for the launch window only,
  and DELETE it as soon as ZCP reports launched. Push back if ZCP
  tries to persist the key anywhere or asks for ongoing prod access.
notableFriction:
  - id: trust-boundary-clarity
    description: |
      ZCP must explicitly tell the user a one-shot key is needed and
      explicitly tell them to delete it after launch. Surfaces
      whether the launched response embeds the delete-key step OR
      buries it in checklist content the agent doesn't surface.
  - id: source-control-mutation-phase
    description: |
      Before the import API call, the launch needs `setup: prod` in
      the source repo's zerops.yaml. Surfaces whether the agent
      drives the write+commit+push step (launch-write-prod-setup
      atom) instead of trying to publish without it.
  - id: scope-classify-narrowing
    description: |
      Launch is stateless multi-call narrowing — scope first, then
      env classification, then ready-to-launch. Surfaces whether the
      agent walks all three calls or short-circuits.
  - id: orphan-project-recovery
    description: |
      If CreateAndImportProject succeeds but a per-service import
      reports an error, the target project is "orphaned" (billable
      empty shell). Surfaces whether the agent reads the
      orphan-project blocker and either deletes the target or
      retries with corrected inputs.

Dev and stage are working — I want to launch production now. Create a separate Zerops project called `myapp-prod` in the eu-central region. I'll generate a one-shot Zerops API key for the launch when you ask, and I'll delete it right after. Don't try to keep any standing access to the prod project — I'll manage prod through the Zerops dashboard and a separate ZCP session once it's up.
